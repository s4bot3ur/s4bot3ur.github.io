# Writeup for Bank Vault

- Before diving into this writeup, itâ€™s crucial to have a solid understanding of Foundry, a powerful framework for Ethereum smart contract development. Foundry will be your primary tool for writing, testing, and breaking contracts in this guide.

### Challenge Description

Bank Vaults is a liquid staking protocol where users can store funds and earn yeild in the form of yeild tokens. The owners has assured me it is secured and no rug pull can occur and users funds are locked in. Can you prove them wrong?

### The Challenge and Exploit

The below are source contracts

1. **Setup** contract

        MockERC20 mockERC20 = new MockERC20(1_000_000 ether);

        // Step 2: Deploy the BankVaults contract with the MockERC20 address
        challengeInstance = new BankVaults{value: 50 ether}(IERC20(address(mockERC20)));
    }

    function isSolved() public view returns (bool) {

```

Our task is to make the `Setup:isSolved` function return true. This function will return true when the balance of the `BankVaults` contract becomes zero. The `BankVaults` contract is initialized with 50 ether during deployment. To solve this challenge, we need to drain and steal the 50 ether from `BankVaults` contract.

```solidity
function stake(address receiver) public payable returns (uint256 shares) {
    require(msg.value > 0, "Must deposit more than 0"); 

    shares = convertToShares(msg.value); 
    balances[receiver] += msg.value; 
    stakeTimestamps[receiver] = block.timestamp; 

    vaultTokenBalances[receiver] += shares; 
    totalSupply += shares; 

    isStaker[receiver] = true; 

    return shares;
}
```

The `stake()` function takes an argument of type `address` (receiver) as input and increases the receiver's balance by the amount of `msg.value` (ETH sent during the call). When someone stakes native ETH, the contract gives vault `tokens` to the receiver. The number of vault token shares is determined by the `BankVaults:convertToShares` function. However, there is no logic implemented in the `BankVaults:convertToShares` functionâ€”it simply returns the amount passed to it.


```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 assets, address receiver, address owner) public override onlyStaker returns (uint256 shares) { 
    require(vaultTokenBalances[owner] >= assets, "Insufficient vault token balance");
    uint256 yield = (assets * 1) / 100;
    uint256 totalReturn = assets + yield;
    require(address(this).balance >= assets, "Insufficient contract balance");  
    shares = convertToShares(assets);
    vaultTokenBalances[owner] -= assets;
    totalSupply -= assets;
    balances[owner] -= assets;
    isStaker[receiver] = false;  
    payable(receiver).transfer(assets);
    return shares;
    }
```

The `withdraw()` function takes three arguments: a `uint256` (`assets`), an `address` (`receiver`), and an `address` (`owner`). The function transfers the staked ETH from the owner to the receiver and reduces the owner's vault token balance. If the owner does not have enough balance, the function will revert.

Additionally, there is no risk of re-entrancy in this function, as it follows the Check-Effect-Interaction (CEI) pattern. This pattern ensures that state changes (like reducing balances) are made before any external calls (such as transferring ETH). Since re-entrancy is not a concern, we should check for other possible ways to drain the contract balance.


```solidity
function flashLoan(uint256 amount, address receiver, uint256 timelock) public {
    require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
    require(balances[msg.sender] > 0, "No stake found for the user");

    unchecked {
        require(timelock >= stakeTimestamps[msg.sender] + MINIMUM_STAKE_TIME, "Minimum stake time not reached");
    }

    require(address(this).balance >= amount, "Insufficient ETH for flash loan");

    uint256 balanceBefore = address(this).balance;

    (bool sent, ) = receiver.call{value: amount}("");
    require(sent, "ETH transfer failed");

    IFlashLoanReceiver(receiver).executeFlashLoan(amount);

    uint256 balanceAfter = address(this).balance;

    require(balanceAfter >= balanceBefore, "Flash loan wasn't fully repaid in ETH");
}
```

The `flashLoan()` function takes three arguments as input: a `uint256` (`amount`), an `address` (`receiver`), and a `uint256` (`timelock`). The function grants a flash loan to the receiver. The receiver must be a contract because, after transferring the ether, the function calls `executeFlashLoan()` on the receiver, and the receiver must repay the loan amount within the same transaction. The `flashLoan()` function can only be called by users who have staked ETH in the contract.

A key feature of this function is that it checks whether the loan has been repaid by comparing the contract's balance before and after the loan transfer. If the balance has decreased (indicating that the loan wasn't fully repaid), the function will revert.

The function expects the loan repayment to be verified by comparing the contract's balance before and after the loan transfer. It uses a low-level call to send the loan amount, and the loan is expected to be repaid within the same transaction. However, if the `stake()` function is called instead of the low-level call, there will be no change in the balance (as the staked ether remains in the contract). As a result, the flashLoan() function will execute successfully, but the contract's balance will be updated to include the loan amount, bypassing the loan repayment check.

Since the loan receiver contract holds the balance after the flash loan transfer, it is possible to directly withdraw the stake of the loan receiver. 

Now It's time to exploit the contract. The below is the exploit script.
